## Some Notes About Mathematics

> + [Notes on moduli space of curves](/ModuliSpaceCurvesReadingNotes.pdf): **(Not finished yet. Update at 2022/11/05)** We will talked about the following topics:
>
>> (1) The basic results:
>> 
>> We first consider the moduli stack of smooth curves and show that it is a smooth locally of finite type Deligne-Mumford stack. Then we discuss detailed properties of the nodal curves and stable curves using some nice tools (such as delta-invariant) and showed that the several stacks are all algebraic stacks locally of finite type over Z. More over we showed the moduli stack of n-pointed stable curves is a quasi-compact smooth Deligne-Mumford stack of dimension 3g−3+n. Next we showed the stable reduction in Char=0 by using some birational geometry of surfaces and calculate a good example, this shows that the moduli stack of n-pointed stable curves is also a proper Deligne-Mumford stack (then by Keel-Mori theorem, we get it has a coarse moduli space). Then we will prove the irreducibility of the moduli stack of stable curves and projectivity of that coarse moduli space (Kollar's method).
>> 
>> (2) Some special topics:
>> 
>>> (2.1) The Picard group of the moduli space of stable curves;
>>>
>>> (2.2) The Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of stable curves (Harris–Mumford–Eisenbud theorem);
>>> 
>>> (2.3) Teichmüller construction of Deligne-Mumford compactification;
>>> 
>>> (2.4) Cellular decomposition and cohomology of the moduli space of curves;
>>> 
>>> (2.5) Alterations and the moduli space of curves ([Alterations-Brian Conrad](http://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~conrad/249BW17Page/index.html));

>> (3) Maybe some recent result...

> + [Notes for Algebraic Spaces and Stacks by M. Olsson](/OlssonNotes.pdf): **(Not finished yet. Update at 2022/09/13)** I take some notes and add some details about the book Algebraic Spaces and Stacks written by Prof. Martin Olsson, aiming to study some basic theory of algebraic stacks.

> + [Notes of blowing up of schemes](/BlowingUp.pdf): **(In Chinese. Not finished yet. Update at 2022/09/03)** I wrote the basic theory of blowing up of schemes including some commutative algebra (Rees algebra), blow-ups and strict transform, U-admissible blow-up and its extension and I also gave a introduction and statement of resolution singularities of char=0 by Hironaka. Finally we gave some examples.

> + [Errata and Notes for Illusie's Topics in Algebraic Geometry](/IllusieErrataNotes.pdf): **(Finished yet at 2022/03/28)** We will fix some typo and errors in this book and take some notes in this file. **I omitted the subsection I.4.14, the section III.4 and the chapter IV!** The original book see [Illusie](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yiouyang/Illusie.pdf).

> + [Review of Basic Algebraic Topology](/SomeAT.pdf):  **(Finished yet at 2022/05/06)** This is a review of basic algebraic topology including the first three chapter of A. Hatcher's book, including fundamental groups, covering spaces, homology and cohomology theory. Moreover we give some proofs of some famous topology theorems, such as Jordan curve theorem, Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem and orientation of compact hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

> + [Some Notes for Goertz and Wedhorn's AGI book 2nd Edition](/AGnotes.pdf): **(Not finished yet. Update at 2022/02/20)** This is a note which aims to fix some gaps in it. The original book see [UT1](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-658-30733-2.pdf). Its official errata see [Errata and Addenda for Algebraic Geometry I](https://www.algebraic-geometry.de/errata/) (I also upload some errata in this website and this book is very nice).

> + [Spectral Sequences](/SpectralSequence.pdf): **(Finished yet)** This is a note about the basic spectral sequences. We first discuss the spectral sequences of exact couples, filered complexes and double complexes. Moreover, we will make some examples to show how them work. Furthermore, we also introduce Cartan-Eilenberg Resolutions and its most important
application, Grothendieck spectral sequences (We have proved it in the notes!) and its applications such as Leray spectral sequences and so on.

> + [Notes on Basic Complex Geometry](/ComManiBasis.pdf): **(Finished yet, the language is Chinese here)** This notes is about basic Complex Geometry including the most basic Hodge theory, some vanishing theorems, Kodaira’s embedding theorem and Riemann-Roch theorem.

> + [Notes on Very Basic Complex Hodge Theory](/2021HODGE.pdf): **(Finished yet)** This notes is about basic Complex Hodge Theory.

> + **[Many Notes in SDU-Taishan colledge](https://dvlxlwz.github.io/SDUTaishanMathLxl.github.io/)**

## Some notes in Seminars in Shandong University (Undergraduate)
> + **(2022 Spring) Seminar of Algebraic Geometry and Rigid Geometry** We used the notes form [Yichao Tian](http://www.mcm.ac.cn/people/members/202108/t20210820_658104.html) about Rigid Geometry (Actually I didn't read the rigid geometry part of this seminar). I will write a notes about some basic facts of Derived Categories in Algebraic Geometry. My notes: [Derived Categories and Algebraic Geometry](/2022RIGIDREADlxl.pdf).

> + **(2022 Spring) Seminar of Symplectic Geometry** We discuss the second chapters of D. Macduff and D. Salamon's Introduction to Symplectic Topology and the Chapter 1-7 in Ana Cannas da Silva's [book](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~acannas/Papers/lsg.pdf). One of my lecture: [Moser's trick](/2022Symp1.pdf).

> + **(2021 Autumn) Seminar of Algebraic Topology** We discuss the first two chapters of R. Nott and L. W. Tu's Differential Froms in Algebraic Topology. I discussed the section 5 and the half of section 11. Here is my lectures:
>> My Lectures: (1) [Section 5](/2021ATSe1.pdf);
>>
>> (2) [Section 11](/2021ATSe2.pdf).

> + **(2020 Autumn) Seminar of Homological Algebra** We discuss the chapter 5-8 of J.J. Rotman's An Introduction to Homological Algebra. I discuss the section 6.1. Here is my lecture notes: [Section6.1](/2020HASe.pdf).
